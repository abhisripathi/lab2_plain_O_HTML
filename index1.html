                    <h2>What’s in a Name?</h2>
                    <p>Shakespeare famously raised that question in “Romeo 
                        and Juliet”, where Juliet dismisses the importance of a 
                        name: “That which we call a rose by any other name 
                        would smell as sweet”. And yet, the name (in their case 
                        their last names, which identified them as belonging to 
                        enemy families) mattered enormously and eventually 
                        contributed to their tragic deaths. In medicine, misunderstandings 
                        about names can have similarly fatal consequences.
                    </p>
                    <h2>Should we rename the diabetes insipidus conditions?</h2>
                    <p>Renaming of diabetes insipidus should be carefully 
                        considered, as it is a well-established medical term. 
                        The first description dates back to 1794, when Johann 
                        Peter Frank of the University of Pavia described patients 
                        characterized by “long continued abnormally increased 
                        secretion of nonsaccharine urine which is not caused by 
                        a diseased condition of the kidneys” and introduced the 
                        term “diabetes insipidus” [5]. This term was picked up in 
                        1892 by McIlraith and has been in clinical use, textbooks 
                        and publications ever since, with “diabetes” referring to 
                        polyuria and “insipidus” to the tasteless nature of the 
                        urine that distinguished it from the sweet tasting polyuria 
                        of “diabetes mellitus” [4]. Yet, with increasing longevity 
                        and affluence, the prevalence of diabetes mellitus has 
                        skyrocketed and consequently has become synonymous 
                        with just “diabetes”. Given this synonymity, misunderstandings 
                        regarding “diabetes insipidus” are probably 
                        inevitable with a high risk of patient harm.

                    <p>While based on self-reporting by patients rather than a 
                        review of documented hospital records, there is no reason 
                        to assume that patients would exaggerate or distort their 
                        experiences. It is, of course, possible that patients who 
                        have experienced mismanagement may be more likely to 
                        participate in such a survey as those who have not experienced 
                        any complications, leading to biased results. Yet, 
                        our own experience with nephrogenic diabetes insipidus 
                        suggests that the proportion of patients reporting confusion of 
                        their condition with diabetes mellitus by health 
                        care professionals is probably realistic. Reluctance to publicly 
                        declare errors leads to an obvious publication bias 
                        so that reports of such confusion and the resulting mismanagement 
                        are rarely, if ever reported in the literature. 
                        Presumably, in most cases, the consequences are minor, 
                        such as repeated unnecessary blood sugar testing, as also 
                        reported by the patients with central diabetes insipidus 
                        in the survey. But in other cases, the consequences may 
                        be more severe, such as failure to obtain electrolytes to 
                        detect and manage hypernatraemic dehydration or treatment with 
                        inappropriate intravenous fluids.
                    </p>
                    <p>Diabetes insipidus, which make sense, as they do reflect 
                        the pathophysiology [5]. But, of course, the issue is complicated 
                        by the fact that the involved hormone has at least 
                        three different names: “vasopressin”, “arginine vasopressin” 
                        and “antidiuretic hormone”. Personally, we would 
                        prefer “antidiuretic hormone deficiency/resistance”, as 
                        the pathophysiology primarily concerns the antidiuretic 
                        effects of the hormone, mediated by the type 2 receptor 
                        AVPR2 in the kidney collecting duct cells, rather than the 
                        vasopressor effects, mediated by AVPR1.
                        The critical and obvious questions are the following: 
                        Would renaming the condition really decrease the frequency of 
                        mismanagement? Would a health care professional be more aware 
                        of the diagnosis and its implications, if a patient told them 
                        that they have a diagnosis 
                        of antidiuretic hormone resistance? The knowledge and 
                        understanding of health care practitioners of such a rare 
                        condition will probably be just as limited, even if the 
                        name clearly reflects the pathophysiology. But the risk 
                        of confusion with “diabetes” is abolished and, when 
                        faced with an unknown rare diagnosis, the health care 
                        professional may be more inclined to look this up or 
                        consult a specialist.

                    <p>The “Working Group for Renaming Diabetes Insipidus” has suggested the terms “vasopressin deficiency” 
                        for cranial and “vasopressin resistance” for nephrogenic diabetes insipidus, which make sense, as they do reflect 
                        the pathophysiology [5]. But, of course, the issue is complicated by the fact that the involved hormone has at least

                    <h2>When the name is a problem: “diabetes insipidus”</h2>
                    <p>Anyone caring for patients with nephrogenic diabetes insipidus 
                        is probably familiar with this scenario: An 
                        afected subject is brought to hospital, for instance because 
                        of a gastrointestinal infection, and when they inform the 
                        staf of the underlying diagnosis, only one word is understood: 
                        “diabetes”. Virtually, every health care professional 
                        is familiar with “diabetes”, a shortening of the name for the 
                        common disorder “diabetes mellitus”. In contrast, “diabetes insipidus” 
                        is rare and many practitioners are unfamiliar with this diagnosis, let 
                        alone its pathophysiology and 
                        management. Consequently, blood sugar may be checked 
                        and the patient reassured and sent home. And even if a set 
                        of electrolytes is obtained and hypernatraemic dehydration 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        revealed, erroneous treatment in the form of isotonic solutions 
                        may be administered, with potentially serious consequences [1]. 
                        Moreover, patients may sufer from iatrogenic hypernatraemia, 
                        if kept nil by mouth for prolonged 
                        periods prior to a planned procedure or given intravenous 
                        fuids with a tonicity that exceeds that of their urine [2]. 
                        Such inadvertent mismanagement is not only experienced 
                        by patients with nephrogenic diabetes insipidus, but also 
                        central diabetes insipidus, as recently reported by a group 
                        of endocrinologists [3]. They performed an online survey 
                        of patients with central diabetes insipidus on their experience 
                        with management and complications of their disease, 
                        awareness of the condition by health care professionals 
                        and their opinion on renaming the condition. More than a 
                        thousand patients participated and the results are sobering.

                    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
                    <p>We therefore propose that like our endocrinology colleagues, 
                        we should survey our patients with nephrogenic 
                        diabetes insipidus and patient advocacy organisations 
                        (such as the <a href="https://ndif.org/">NDI foundation</a>), as well 
                        as our nephrology colleagues, through our national 
                        and international professional societies, with respect 
                        to experiences of diagnostic confusion with the term 
                        “diabetes” and their thoughts and ideas about renaming 
                        the condition. Central diabetes insipidus is typically treated with desmopressin, 
                        yet roughly a quarter of participants reported difficulties in accessing desmopressin 
                        when in hospital (e.g. for acute illness or elective surgery), typically because of 
                        non-availability or absence of a prescription. More than 
                        half reported being asked to abstain from drinking and eating for medical reasons during hospitalisations and 54% 
                        of those reported receiving no intravenous fuids during that time.
                    </p>
                    <p> We believe that if supported by those surveyed, and a consensus is built, 
                        replacement of “DI” by 
                        the terms “ADH Deficiency” and “ADH Resistance” will 
                        benefit patients, their families and health care providers. 
                        She dismissed the importance of different names for the 
                        same thing, as it was the characteristics that mattered 
                        (“That which we call a rose by any other name would 
                        smell as sweet”). In contrast, we have the problem of 
                        having the same name for two different conditions, with 
                        clearly different characteristics: That which we call diabetes (insipidus) 
                        does not taste sweet!
